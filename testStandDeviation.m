% Please run GUI in the command window to have an easy access to 
% all the thresholding tests You can also run the thresholding test
% directly by changing some codes here

% Read the chosen image from GUI
% You can also use the code delow to read the image directly
% f = rgb2gray(imread('files/lena.jpg'));
f = rgb2gray(imread(get(handles.FileNameEdit,'String')));

% Get the size of the image
[m, n] = size(f);

% Get the defined radius r from GUI
% You can also use the code below to define the radius and k directly
% r = 4;
r = str2double(get(handles.RadiusEdit,'String'));

% Define a pic for calculation
pic = f;

% Caculate the ranges of coordinates
for i=1:m
    for j=1:n
    % Calculate the minimum x-coordinate value of the 
    % bounding square of the circle defined by radius r
    xr0 = i-r;
    if(xr0 < 1) 
       xr0 = 1;
    end

    % Calculate the maximun x-coordinate value of the
    % bounding square of the circle defined by radius r
    xr1 = i+r;
    if(xr1 > m)
        xr1 = m;
    end

    % Calculate the minimun y-coordinate value of the
    % bounding square of the circle defined by radius r
    yr0 = j-r;
    if(yr0 < 1)
        yr0 = 1;

    % bounding square of the circle defined by radius r
    yr1 = j+r;

    % Do the local adaptive thresholding
